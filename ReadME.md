# Welcome to DaShooter!
DaShooter is a rather decent game where you try to kill a not-so-powerful enemy which gets sronger each time you kill it. This game can range from no-skill to one which requires a lot of skill and timing to strike the target and get better accuracy statistics. This game does not have a working leadorboard.


# GamePlay
## Control
1. Press 'W' and 'S' to move the gun.
2. Press 'space' to shoot
3. Press 'q' or 'e' to change gun type and also automatically shoot at intervals
4. Press 'r' to restart
5. Press 'f' to switch to manual shooting mode ~With future key changes to be made. change accordingly.
6. Press '3' to launch a bomb (you have limited bombs)
7. Press '2' to launch a nuke (FAR MORE LIMITED!)
8. Press 'p' to pause. Recommended for gamers who need to take a toilet break every few minutes hehe.

## Instruction
If you are using manual mode, use your bullets wisely as gun reloading will take place if you run out of bullets.
Bombs deals more damage than a normal bullet.
Nuke deals MUCH more damage than a bomb.
10 bombs give you a nuke.
The boss and you will become more powerful after each time you defeat the boss.
The boss's max health will increase, but yours would not increase during a game restart.
You will heal over time.

## Objective
Your goal is to shoot balls at the target to decrease its health to zero and get as many rebirths as possible.   

## Enjoyment
Have fun playing the game and try to improve your accuracy each attempt.
Experiment with different strategies to defeat the target more efficiently and get more rebirths.

## Game Over:
Each time the target's health is reduced to zero, you get a rebirth.
If your health is reduced to zero, the game ends and you get some statistics on how well you did.
